Program.cs - main file
CharMatrix.cs - file for class

Task:
Write a program in the C# programming language that describes a class with an indexer and a property according to the variant and tests the operation of the indexer and the property.

My variant:
The class encapsulates a two-dimensional array of character type elements. Create a one-dimensional indexer that returns a string consisting of all elements of one of the two diagonals. Create a property that controls access to a variable that contains the number of vowels in the array.
